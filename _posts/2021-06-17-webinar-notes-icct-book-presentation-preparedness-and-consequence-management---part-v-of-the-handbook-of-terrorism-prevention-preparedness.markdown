## Notes

- **Panic reduction/mitigation** strategies:
	- Rapid restoration of normalcy
	- Reducing uncertainty and
	- Building government trust

- Three themes of particular relevance appear most prominent in the research on **decreasing uncertainty and increasing community resilience**:
	- **Preparation:** Development of numerous national-level disaster preparedness plans, several of which focus prominently on fostering resilience for community members and critical infrastructure.
	- **Communication:** Overall, the research literature highlights three areas of recommendations for government leaders that are fairly applicable in any community setting worldwide:
		1 Communicate effectively, provide accurate, truthful information before, during and after an incident. 
		2. Focus on influencing perceptions of competence, trust and good faith - before, during and after an incident - which can do a lot to reduce fear and panic; and 
		3. 3. Set an example in what you communicate and how you communicate, because if you remain calm, others will follow your lead accordingly.
	- **Empowerment:** Having a structure in place for community volunteers to get involved in response efforts is an essential form of empowerment. Further, beyond empowering individual members of the public to be proactive in the face of terrorist threats, these types of efforts help create social bonding among community members, which also reduces panic in the wake of terrorist attacks. In fact, research has found evidence that the existence of such bonds among social groups may play a greater role in determining whether panic ensues than the response of the authorities themselves during an emergency.

- While **community resilience** may be difficult to define, it is even more challenging to measure or to identify and implement effective strategies for improving it.
- Ideas of **self-efficacy** are based upon the transfer of accountability to communities by building stronger societal pillars that can withstand shocks from man-made events such as terrorist incidents as well as natural disasters.
- **Closing remarks:** Policies and strategies based on solid research can benefit governments and communities worldwide. Unfortunately, there are widespread beliefs and assumptions about panic in the wake of a terrorist attack that are largely based on myth rather than fact. And when the media (and some politicians) encourage myth-making by envisioning a mass of panicked and passive victims in the wake of a terrorist attack, this leads to policies that are at best unhelpful, and potentially even counterproductive. But rather than encouraging fear (and even trying to capitalize on that fear for the sake of political agendas and profits), we must acknowledge the many things that individuals, families and communities can do - with and without their government’s involvement - to strengthen community resilience. Commitments and investments in these areas are bound to yield more sophisticated and successful measures to prevent public panic in the wake of a terrorist incident.

- Economic costs:
	- Bali 1 (2002): U.S. $1,800 million - $2,000 million (1,8 billion - 2 billion) in lost. Resulted in a decrease of hotel occupancy by 44.6%.
	- Bali 2 (2005): Primarily worked to compound economic effects of Bali 1 and cause further psychological damage; 10% decrease in hotel occupancy.

- **Bali 1 (2002)**
	- **Jema'ah Islamiya (JI)** is a splinter group of Darul Islam (DI).
	- Crafted by Abdullah Sungkar in 1992.
	- After Abdullah's death Abu Bakyr Ba'aysir became the predominant figure.
	- International systems factors and nation-state level factor provide "political space" for JI to grow.
	- Also nurture ties to al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
	- **International systems factors:**
		- Asian economic crisis
		- SARS virus outbreak
		- Global war on terrorism/War in Afghanistan
	- **Nation-state factors:**
		- The fragility of the Suharto regime
		- Economic crises for most marginalized Indonesians
		- Separatist movements and conflict between religious groups.
	- **Bali 2 (2005)**
		- Al-Qaeda in the Malay Archipelago (Tanzim Qaedat al-Jihad); a Jema'ah Islamiya "splinter group".
	- **The "Terrorist Group-Life Cycle" (Lasswell)**: cascade of international and "nation-state" factor effects.
	- **Economic diversification:** The need for countries highly dependent on tourism to diversify the economy to promote economic and societal resilience.
	- **Civil society is intrinsic to combat terrorism in effective and sustained ways**
	- **Multilateralism:** The need for anticipatory government sponsored insurance programs in Indonesia, with public-private-partnership emphasis; perhaps a formation of a worldwide counterterrorism insurance program.
	- **Importance of effective political institutionalization:** where bureaucracies, including the army and political parties, reflect broad segments of society.
	- **Importance of effective counterterrorism legislation:**
		- Negative sanctions with "teeth"
		- Effective organization of security forces to facilitate more seamless coordination
		- Deradicalization and rehabilitation programs
		- Public-private partnership initiatives and opportunities
		- Use of "positive sanctions" for terrorist constituent groups

- Marie Robin started by talking about a hearth touching event- Paris Bataclan concert attack which resulted in 89 deaths, including Helene Muyal-Leiris, a wife and a mother of a 17-month old. Her husband posted [a message](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/paris-terror-husband-pays-touching-tribute-love-his-life-defiant-message-attackers-a6737231.html) on Facebook and wrote a beautiful sentence: “Vous n’aurez pas ma vengeance”, "You won’t have my vengeance".
- ![four types of reactions to terrorism](/img/webinar/2021june/icct5.png)
- Measures and recommendations:
	- **Fight the need:** 
		- By presenting an accurate evaluation of the actual threat
		- By offering transparency about the actions taken by the state and its security forces
		- By rebuilding trust between State and society
		- By encouraging recruitment to the military and the police from every segment of society
	- **Fight the divisions:**
		- By establishing a clear distinction between terrorists and ordinary citizens
		- By promoting inter-community dialogue
		- By promoting neutral, inter-community media
		- By countering statements that seek to recall again and again past terrorist attacks. p.s. Statements with the goal of stigmatizing and marginalizing entire communities.
	- **Fight the means:**
		- By reviewing legislation on the private possession and use of arms
		- By ensuring accountability and judicial sanctions against those who act as vigilantes and avengers.

![cover4](/img/webinar/2021june/icct6.png)
- Terrorism is a contingent political strategy.
- **Provoking governments to overreact** to the threat they pose by 
	- introducing draconian security measures, 
	- curtailing civil liberties, 
	- and infringing established human rights protections.
- This **results in:**
	- Greater societal polarization
	- The radicalization of greater numbers of the terrorists' potential constituents
	- The undermining of the state's legitimacy both at home and abroad.
- *Political jiu-jitsu*
- **Core themes of terrorist doctrine:**
	- Provoking an overreaction
	- Contesting legitimacy
- International human rights law actually accords States considerable latitude in responding to terrorist threats.
- Social science research has identified state abuses as a major - perhaps the major - **driver of terrorist recruitment**.
- Most states focus on the resilience of critical systems and of public morale, but not on the resiliency of national laws and values.
- Tom Parker also talked briefly about his new book, [Avoiding the Terrorist Tap](https://www.avoidingtheterroristtrap.org). He also shared two discount codes but I am not comfortable sharing as I don't know what he wants. The webinar was also streamed on Youtube so I guess you can head there.

- Substantive Priority Areas of the **UN Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism:**
	- Dialogue and conflict prevention
	- Strengthening good governance, human rights and the rule of law
	- Engaging communities
	- Empowering youth
	- Gender equality and empowering women
	- Education, skill development and employment facilitation
	- Strategic communications, the internet and the social media
- ![correlation](/img/webinar/2021june/icct8.png)
	- *NEET is an acronym for Not in Education, Employment, or Training*
- **Institute for Economics & Peace Findings:**
	- High levels of group grievance and a weak rule of law is correlated with terrorism across all countries.
	- In the more economically developed countries, social disenfranchisement and exclusion play an important role in terrorism.
	- In less economically developed countries, religious or ethnic ruptures, and corruption are more strongly associated with high levels of terrorism.
- One important cause of non-state terrorism is a desire to **exact revenge** for some perceived or real injustice that has **not been adequately addressed** by the existing political system.
- Many terrorists want to **produce an over-reaction** with their atrocities, expecting that government will target and repress the terrorists' professed constituency as a whole, which is likely to drive new recruits into the arms of the terrorist organization.
- Limit the possibilities for terrorists to obtaining free **publicity** with their public outrages.
- **Preventing polarization** in society, protecting minorities against **hate crimes** while engaging in strengthening social cohesion and resilience and engaging in conflict resolution goes a long way in preventing terrorism at home.
