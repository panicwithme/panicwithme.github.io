## Notes
![cover](/img/webinar/2021june/extremism1.png)

- What **drives** a rational person towards radical ideologies/groups?
	- **Instinct Theory:** Behavior is a function of a person's instinct rather than conscious, purposeful and rational activities.
	- **Reinforcement Theory:** Person's current behavior strongly affected by knowledge of rewards for similar past behaviors.
	- **Cognitive Theory:** Behaviour is not much a function of consequences, as it is a person's future belief and expectations.
- **Need for Affiliation**
	- Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
	- Anxiety and stress feeds
	- The pandemic fed the beast
- A deconstructured ideology must be replaced with something else... Herein lies the dilemma.
- Group gives members an **identity** and demands (or subtly elicits) **loyalty** for the sense of security imparted.
- **Group culture:**
	- Values
	- Norms
	- Artifacts: Rituals, places, dates, symbols, colors, dress
	- Environment: Closed system or open?
- **Nonviolent Extremism**
	- Radical preaching, writing, think tanks
	- Inspiring, inciting, recruiting, boosting morale, fundraising
- **Violent Extremism**
	- Perception of being marginalized, discriminated against, ridiculed, persecuted
	- Convert or eliminate
- Maybe the violent actor has grievances and seeks revenge or is coercede, paid, manipulated, or shamed into participating but eventually original "hook" evolves into greed. Sometimes violent extremism becomes a career.
- The internet accelerates the speed of radicalization, **provides interface between recruiters/recruits** and gives 24/7 access to tactical info.
- **Online Recruitment Strategy:**
	1. Seek out
	2. Isolate
	3. Encourage
	- Can take months, years or days.
	- [Example: Ohio State attacker](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/29/us/ohio-state-university-attack/index.html)
- **Extremism in the U.S.**
	- **Right Wing:** neo-Nazism, neo-fascism, white nationalism, religious nationalism, anti-government patriots, militias, sovereign citizens
	- **Left Wing:** Revolutionary socialism, antifascism, anarchism
	- **Religious:** Most dangerous - apocalyptic, martyrs
	- **Single Interest:** Animals, plant life, climate change
	- **Wildcards:** Male supremacism (incel, misogynist), ad hoc groups like the Proud Boys, Boogaloo Bois
- Boogaloo Bois is interesting as it has supporters from different segments like BLM supporters, right-wing, incels all against the government. From Meme to Movement to Murder. [News](https://www.salon.com/2020/06/17/far-right-boogaloo-boy-killed-officer-after-using-black-lives-matter-protest-as-cover-prosecutors/)
- **Domestic Violent Extremists (DVE) of Greatest Concern**
	- QAnon conspiracy theorists
	- Anarchist extremists
	- Militia extremists
- **DHS CT Insights**
	- Most **significant terrorist threat** to the US are **lone actors or small groups** based on an ideological group they connect with online - combination of beliefs and personal grievances.
	- Threat comes from people who have a **superficial understanding of the ideology**. They are angry, disconnected, treated unfairly, and participating in these groups provides a sense of self-worth.
- **Lone Actor Terror (LAT)**
	- Individuals who prepare for and execute violence without external assistance.
	- Despite ad hoc nature and limited resources, can mount high-profile, extremely destructive attacks.
	- Two types:
		- Well adapted to society - makes a tactical choice to engage in lone actor ops; leaves society
		- Not well adapted, suffering mental health issues or in psychological distress; society leaves them
- Protests or acts of violence may put your organization in the crosshairs - you must continuously assess the threat. Your ability to deter attack is amplified by understanding vulnerability.
- Find your Achilles Heel and cover it.
- **Divert/off-road:** Conceal, cover, disguise; lower the heat.
- **Deter:** 
	- Use security language on your websites, social media.
	- Display robust security signage and have a security presence.
- **Deceive**: Physical deception tactics - look harder than you are.
- Remember: The best defense is a good offense.

- The NITTF defines the 5 **categories of Insider Threat** as:
	- Leaks
	- Spills
	- Espionage
	- Sabotage
	- Targeted Violence
- Many known **insider threats** have been associated with one or more of the following **behavioral indicators**:
	- Significant changes in personality, behavior, or work habits
	- Substance abuse or addictive behaviors
	- Financial change
	- Disgruntled to the point of wanting to retaliate
	- Disaffection, marginalization, alienation
	- Disregard for security procedures and protocols
	- Ideations on social media and/or in the workplace
- The Fifth Column means a group or people sympathetic to or working for adversaries.
- Be attune to the "human condition".
- Access large body of academic thought on violent extremism.
- Stay abreast of current groups, activities, targets and tactics then adjust your security plans.
